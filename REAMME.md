Before I started writing code in the IDE, I wrote pseudocode to help me decide the most logical way to solve the 
problem.

I also made sure I understood the rules of the game by drawing out grids on paper and applying the rules of the game 
to produce the next generation grid. I started to combine the rules adding them in one by one until I had one grid 
which would trigger all the rules. 

I also used the grids I had drawn to help make sure I had covered all the tests I needed to write within my code.

1. Once you have pulled the branch run `composer install`
2. To run the test in a terminal run `composer test` this will run all the tests
3. To quit out of the test run, you just need to type `q` and press return
4. I added in the watch, so it was faster for me to code and get feedback

I used a few google and stack overflow materials:
